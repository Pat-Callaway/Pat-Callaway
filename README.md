## Hi there 


I’m Patrick — DevOps Engineer / MDM Admin building toward Software Engineering.
I work at the intersection of Android, Enterprise Mobility Management, and automation, with a focus on modernizing legacy EMM systems and improving reliability through scripting and tooling.
-  Focus: Android + EMM tooling, automation, legacy modernization
-  Learning: software engineering fundamentals + building in public
-  Tech: Java, Python, scripting (and whatever helps ship the solution)
-  GitHub goal: document what I learn and share reusable tools/templates
